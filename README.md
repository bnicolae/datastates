# DataStates
Data states, intermediate representations of datasets, allow applications to effectively reduce the complexity of data management, while enabling an optimized runtime to take advantage of heterogeneous storage at large scale to improve the performance and scalability of their applications.

For now this is a placeholder but stay tuned, a release is planned soon.
